Web Application Challenge
=========================

This challenge is pretty simple: make a basic web application.

During our Web App lesson we used an awesome framework called
`Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_, which is a good choice
if this is your first web application.

If you're looking for even more of a challenge, or 
are better with one of the following languages than python,
you might also consider one of these frameworks instead:

* `Ruby on Rails <http://rubyonrails.org/>`_ -- Ruby
* `Sinatra <http://www.sinatrarb.com/>`_ -- Ruby
* `AngularJS <https://angularjs.org/>`_ -- Javascript
* `EmberJS <http://emberjs.com/>`_ -- Javascript
* `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/>`_ -- Python
* `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ -- Python (larger framework)

Or you can make an app without a framework!

You can refer back to `our systemview app <https://github.com/DevOpsBootcamp/systemview>`_
for an example of a flask app, and of course feel free to ask us questions!

You can also refer to `this guide <http://lug.oregonstate.edu/blog/webdev/>`_ for more
generic guidance in creating a web application.

Need a good idea?  Here are a couple to give you inspiration:

* A simple blog with comments
* Make a website with users that you need to log in to
* Make a portfolio website for the work you've done so far (more design than application)
* To-do list app to send you emails when you need to do things
* RSS news feed
* Simple image gallery
* Unit converter (ie. Kilometers to miles, binary to decimal, etc.)
* Quiz application

Or dream up your own!
